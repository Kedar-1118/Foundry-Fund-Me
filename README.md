# ðŸª™ Foundry Fund Me

This is a beginner-friendly smart contract project built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), inspired by the Cyfrin Solidity Course.

Users can send ETH to the contract if the donation meets a minimum USD value. It uses a **Chainlink Price Feed** to convert ETH to USD. The contract also keeps track of all funders.
